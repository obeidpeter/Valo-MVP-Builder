# Roles and permission matrix

Permissions are server enforced, deny by default, tenant scoped and constrained by engagement assignment. UI hiding is not authorisation. A role may never override `INV-04` through `INV-14`.

`*` requires the applicable delegation/dual control. `**` partner QA cannot replace mandatory Valo co-sign where the product is Valo-branded.

## Segregation rules

1. The person who proposes a fatal downgrade cannot independently approve it.
2. The author of a material factual claim cannot be its sole evidence approver and final quality signatory.
3. Payment reconciliation cannot be performed by the same identity that changed the price-book/entitlement rule for that transaction.
4. A platform administrator cannot grant themselves tenant content access.
5. A deletion executor cannot delete legal-hold data or delete the immutable audit/anchor evidence.
6. Break-glass requires an incident/support ticket, tenant, scope, reason, approving identity, expiry, prominent tenant notification unless legally prohibited, and after-action review.
7. Time-limited grants expire server-side and are rechecked on every request/job, not only at login.
8. Partner roles receive access through both partner-client relationship and engagement assignment; either revocation denies access.

## Authorisation decision inputs

`actor_id`, `actor_tenant_id`, `role_grants`, `resource_tenant_id`, `engagement_assignment`, `partner_relationship`, `purpose`, `grant_expiry`, `feature_entitlement`, `object_state`, and `break_glass_context` are evaluated at the API and in worker execution. Database RLS is the backstop for tenant-owned rows; object storage paths/policies and retrieval indexes use the same immutable tenant identifier.

## Review evidence

Every permission row needs allow and deny tests, cross-tenant variants, expired-grant variants, and audit assertions. Until those tests pass against a disposable real PostgreSQL service with RLS enabled, this matrix is a requirement, not verified implementation.
