# C4 level 1 — system context

**Current:** The people, Valo boundary, Clerk relationship, and activation-gated provider relationship are present in source contracts.

**Target:** Additional approved provider capabilities and an independent audit witness may extend the context without moving human approval authority outside Valo.

**Deployed:** Replit is configured as the hosting platform; live integrations require an external deployment record and are not established by this diagram.

**Verified:** Source and contract tests cover identity, tenant, permission, provider, and human-authority rules. This view is not live connectivity evidence.

The platform is one software system at this level. PostgreSQL, the browser SPA, the Node API, and object storage are internal containers and appear in [CONTAINERS.md](CONTAINERS.md). GitHub Actions and Replit promotion are delivery infrastructure and appear in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

## People and authority

| Person                             | Primary goals                                                                    | Authority boundary                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client approver or bid-team member | Supply evidence, review gaps, respond to actions, approve within assigned scope. | A browser claim never establishes tenant, identity, readiness, price, or approval. Direct membership and current grants remain server decisions.                                                            |
| Consultancy partner                | Work in explicitly delegated client/project scope.                               | Partner-derived access is capped by the relationship and route policy. Sensitive direct-membership workspaces and release authority remain unavailable unless separately granted through an allowed source. |
| Valo analyst/reviewer              | Extract, reconcile, review, test, sign, and assemble governed outputs.           | AI suggestions and deterministic preflights do not substitute for the named human required by the workflow. Maker-checker and current-grant rules apply.                                                    |
| Valo operations/administrator      | Manage configuration, evidence, incidents, and bounded control-plane workflows.  | No global platform role bypasses tenant RLS. Owner-only migration or maintenance identities are not interactive application roles.                                                                          |

Role and access details are governed by the [permissions matrix](../implementation-v2.5/PERMISSIONS_MATRIX.md), current middleware under [`artifacts/api-server/src/middlewares`](../../artifacts/api-server/src/middlewares/), and the Workbench [role/route matrix](../ui-overhaul/ROLE_ROUTE_MATRIX.md).

## External-system relationships

| External system               | Current relationship                                                                                                            | Data/authority rule                                                                                                                                                                        | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clerk                         | Authenticates the browser session used by the API.                                                                              | Clerk proves session identity; Valo maps it to a local active user, selected organisation, access source, roles, and permissions.                                                          | [`app.ts`](../../artifacts/api-server/src/app.ts), [`auth.ts`](../../artifacts/api-server/src/middlewares/auth.ts), [Clerk proxy middleware](../../artifacts/api-server/src/middlewares/clerkProxyMiddleware.ts) |
| Managed object storage        | Stores private uploaded/generated bytes behind Valo metadata and scoped access.                                                 | Object paths are not authorisation. Tenant/database records, hashes, state, and signed access mediate every governed use.                                                                  | [object-storage service](../../artifacts/api-server/src/lib/objectStorage.ts), [storage lifecycle](../../artifacts/api-server/src/lib/storageLifecycle/)                                                         |
| Model/OCR and other providers | Available only through typed adapters and capability-specific gates; several production effects remain disabled or unconnected. | Providers receive no database, object-store, shell, or arbitrary-network credentials. Missing governance, region, retention, budget, health, or release evidence denies disclosure/effect. | [provider contracts](../../artifacts/api-server/src/lib/providerContracts.ts), [AI architecture](../ai-overhaul/TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md), [provider ADR](../implementation-v2.5/adrs/0005-provider-adapters.md)   |

A local hash chain alone is not external anchoring.                                                                                                       | [audit anchoring ADR](../implementation-v2.5/adrs/0004-audit-anchoring.md), [schedule manifest](../../config/operations/schedules.v1.json)                                                                       |

## Valo responsibilities

Valo is responsible for authenticated tenant selection, permission and object checks, evidence/version integrity, deterministic gates, suggestion containment, named-human decisions, package provenance, audit evidence, privacy-safe operations, and truthful failure states.

Valo does **not** guarantee an award or evaluator acceptance, invent evidence or credentials, autonomously approve/sign/submit a bid, infer a tenant from client input, or claim an external action happened without a reconciled receipt. Product boundaries are detailed in the [user manual](../USER_MANUAL.md) and [product requirements](../implementation-v2.5/PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md).

## Trust boundaries

1. The browser and every request body are untrusted.
2. An authenticated identity is not yet a tenant permission decision.
3. Application authorisation precedes transaction-local database tenant context; RLS is defence in depth, not authentication.
4. Object storage and providers are outside the application/database trust boundary.
5. Generated suggestions, uploaded text, OCR, and provider output remain untrusted data until deterministic validation and human review.
6. Build, deployment, and runtime identity are separate authorities; a source commit alone is not a deployed release.

See [dynamic flows](DYNAMIC_FLOWS.md) for the request and release sequences.
