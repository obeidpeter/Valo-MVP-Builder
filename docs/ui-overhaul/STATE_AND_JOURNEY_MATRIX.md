# State and journey matrix

Status: UI mapping for the current deterministic workflow. Server state, version checks, permissions, and readiness results are authoritative; client summaries are explanatory only.

## Engagement lifecycle

| Phase                     | Authoritative stages                                                 | Primary surface                                   | Exit evidence                                                   |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Access and onboarding     | `organisation_onboarding`, `identity_verification`, `nda_privacy`    | Identity, organisation settings, client workspace | Active membership/role, privacy/NDA state                       |
| Tender governance         | `tender_identification`, `conflict_review`, `entitlement_validation` | Pursuit overview/governance                       | Tender/lot, conflict clear/consented, payment/entitlement gate  |
| Intake and processing     | `secure_intake`, `document_processing`                               | Documents                                         | Storage receipt, SHA-256, inspection verdict, extraction state  |
| Review and assignment     | `requirement_review`, `work_assignment`                              | Requirements and operations                       | Named-human rulings, citations, owners/deadlines                |
| Resolution and production | `remediation`, `grounded_drafting`, `boq_verification`               | Evidence, defects, BOQ, future drafting surface   | Approved evidence, resolved material defects, BOQ result        |
| Independent challenge     | `red_team_review`, `reviewer_approval`                               | Defects, readiness, reports                       | Red-team result and independent approval                        |
| Release                   | `package_assembly`, `named_signoff`, `export_delivery`               | Reports/package controls                          | Server readiness pass, signer, immutable export record/manifest |
| Close                     | `outcome_capture`, `archived`                                        | Overview/audit                                    | Outcome, retention/legal-hold instruction, approved archive     |

Terminal alternatives are `withdrawn` and `cancelled`. Terminal records cannot be mutated.

## Transition events

| Event              | Allowed transition                                   | Required UI inputs and result                                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `progress`         | Exactly one lifecycle stage forward                  | Current version; named sign-off additionally requires the full server readiness gate. |
| `retry_processing` | `document_processing` to itself                      | Reconciliation/recovery complete; preserve prior attempt and show new version.        |
| `replace_document` | `document_processing` to `secure_intake`             | Reason; new integrity/version checks; prior document remains attributable.            |
| `apply_addendum`   | Active review/release stages to `requirement_review` | Reason and source version; mark downstream approvals/packages stale.                  |
| `reopen`           | Eligible downstream stage to `remediation`           | Authorised owner and reason; invalidate downstream approval/export state.             |
| `withdraw`         | Any non-terminal stage to `withdrawn`                | Owner approval and reason.                                                            |
| `cancel`           | Any non-terminal stage to `cancelled`                | Owner approval and reason.                                                            |
| `archive`          | `outcome_capture` to `archived`                      | Owner approval; retention and legal hold remain in force.                             |

Every transition uses optimistic version matching. Stale versions prompt reload/compare; they never auto-retry a material decision.

## Domain states

| Domain             | States                                                                         | UI rule                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Secure intake      | ready, quarantined, rejected, duplicate; provider unavailable                  | No unsafe preview; name the finding class and retained/purged disposition.                      |
| Document inclusion | `excluded`, `redacted`, `included`                                             | New uploads begin excluded; only reviewed included/redacted content can process.                |
| Extraction         | `pending`, `extracting`, `extracted`, `failed`, `skipped`, `quarantined`       | Show method/confidence/notes; failed/skipped is never complete. Quarantined is excluded, not generically downloadable, and has no ordinary release or extraction action. |
| Requirement review | `suggested`, `pending`, `confirmed`, `edited`, `rejected`                      | Suggested/pending needs human ruling; only confirmed/edited are authoritative requirements.     |
| Evidence           | `pending`, `present`, `missing`, `expired`, `unclear`, `not_applicable`        | Mandatory evidence resolves only through approved `present`/`not_applicable`, not a suggestion. |
| Defect severity    | fatal, likely-fatal, scoring-risk, cosmetic                                    | Never collapse severity into color or award probability.                                        |
| Defect status      | suggested, open, remediated, waived                                            | Suggested needs review; open fatal/likely-fatal blocks release; downgrade/waiver is governed.   |
| BOQ check          | ok, flagged, pushed-to-defect                                                  | Flagged blocks when applicable; never generate or recommend a rate.                             |
| Report             | draft, signed-off                                                              | Signer must have permission and satisfy independent/readiness rules.                            |
| Pursuit summary    | intake, extraction, review, defects, reporting, signed-off, exported, archived | Summary is compatible UI grouping, not a substitute for the full workflow state.                |
| Feature            | active, pending activation, denied                                             | UI flag does not grant permission, provider readiness, or server activation.                    |

## Known state gaps

Dedicated finance/signatory roles, complete billing ledger, external notification delivery, configured OCR, durable job orchestration, partner co-sign workflow, and complete persisted package lifecycle are not UI-complete. Their states remain `unavailable`, `pending`, or `partial`; do not simulate success with optimistic copy or disabled buttons that appear actionable.
