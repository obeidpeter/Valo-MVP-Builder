# Release provenance and deployment verification

Status: source tooling implemented; GitHub rulesets, protected environments,
Replit configuration and live evidence still require an authorised operator.
Nothing in this document authorises a deployment.

## Merge controls

`.github/branch-policy.json` is the reviewed desired state for `main` and
`.github/CODEOWNERS` defines the accountable reviewer. CI validates that every
named required check still exists and that the fail-closed policy has not been
weakened. A repository file cannot configure GitHub protection by itself.

An administrator must create a branch ruleset for `main` with:

- pull requests and one approval;
- code-owner review, stale-approval dismissal, approval of the most recent
  push, and resolved conversations;
- strict `CI / verify`, `CodeQL / analyse`, and
  `Dependency review / dependency-review` checks;
- force pushes and branch deletion blocked; and
- administrators included with no standing bypass actor.

After applying it, compare the live settings with `.github/branch-policy.json`
and retain the ruleset URL/export in the private operations record. Configure
protected `staging` and `production` environments separately, allow deployment
from the `main` branch only, and require at least one reviewer. Production must
also prevent self-review.

## Candidate creation

Run the **Release candidate** workflow from protected `main` only, with a full
commit SHA already reachable from `main`. It checks out that exact object,
uses workflow-owned Git commands to prove exact HEAD, tracked cleanliness and
`main` ancestry before executing any checked-out script, builds the API and
Workbench, produces a CycloneDX SBOM, and writes
`release-evidence/release-manifest.json`. The manifest contains:

- the full source commit;
- a sorted SHA-256 inventory for every built artifact file;
- aggregate API and Workbench artifact digests;
- the SBOM digest and format;
- bounded GitHub workflow provenance; and
- `releaseSha256`, the stable digest of the source and aggregate release
  artifacts.

The workflow reverifies all bytes before uploading one 90-day GitHub artifact.
Copy accepted evidence to the approved immutable release store before that
retention window expires. The repository intentionally ignores
`release-evidence/`; never commit a live deployment record or private provider
metadata.

Every third-party action in both release workflows is pinned to the reviewed
40-character upstream commit. A version comment is descriptive only; the tag is
never used for execution. The Anchore step disables its own artifact upload,
release-asset upload and dependency-snapshot side effects. Only the final,
digest-bound Valo bundle is uploaded. Re-resolve and review every upstream
commit before changing a pin.

For an offline rehearsal after both production builds and SBOM creation:

```sh
node scripts/release-provenance.mjs create \
  --expected-source-commit <full-current-HEAD> \
  --artifact api-server=artifacts/api-server/dist \
  --artifact workbench=artifacts/valo-workbench/dist \
  --sbom valo-sbom.cdx.json \
  --output release-evidence/release-manifest.json
```

The command refuses a mismatched HEAD, tracked changes, symlinked evidence,
empty artifacts, malformed CycloneDX input, duplicate artifacts, or an existing
output file.

## Bind the runtime

Before publishing, inject the candidate's `releaseSha256` into the target as
`VALO_RELEASE_SHA256` through the approved environment-secret mechanism. It is
not a secret, but environment-scoping prevents one target from claiming
another candidate. Never pin this candidate-specific value in `.replit`, a
checked-in `.replit-artifact/artifact.toml`, or another tracked source file. Do
not paste credentials or the optional probe authorization value into source,
workflow inputs, logs, or deployment records.

The exact health routes publish `X-Valo-Release-Sha256` only when the configured
value is a lowercase 64-character digest. This is a deployment-controlled,
environment-declared identity; it is not a hash measured from the running
bytes. Liveness remains dependency-free and readiness still requires the
accepting lifecycle plus the bounded database probe. A missing or malformed
identity does not make the process unhealthy, but it makes deployment
verification fail closed.

Replit currently rebuilds from a source snapshot. The CI artifact inventory is
therefore candidate evidence, not independent proof that Replit ran the same
bytes. The generated verification record explicitly says
`runtimeIdentityEvidence: environment_declared` and
`liveArtifactDigestVerified: false`. Record the exact Replit source snapshot,
provider build evidence, and immutable deployment ID. Do not claim byte-for-byte
artifact promotion unless the platform supplies and the operator verifies a
runtime artifact digest.

## Verify the deployment

Set the `VALO_DEPLOYMENT_ORIGIN` configuration variable independently on each
protected GitHub environment. It must be the exact HTTPS origin without a path,
query, fragment or credential. A workflow caller cannot override this value,
which prevents the optional edge authorization secret from being sent to a
caller-chosen host.

Run **Deployment verification** with the candidate workflow run ID, full source
commit SHA, immutable provider deployment ID, and protected environment. It
checks out that exact source, proves it remains reachable from `main`, and then:

1. queries the GitHub Actions run in the current repository and requires the
   exact `release-candidate.yml` path and name, protected `main` workflow ref,
   manual-dispatch event, completed status, successful conclusion, canonical
   run URL and the requested source in its display title;
2. downloads only the source-named artifact from that attested run into
   isolated runner-temporary storage, outside both the trusted checkout and the
   separately written run attestation;
3. requires the manifest repository ID/name, workflow path/name/SHA, run
   ID/attempt/URL and source commit to match the run attestation;
4. recomputes every candidate artifact and SBOM digest;
5. checks `/api/healthz` and `/api/readyz` without redirects;
6. requires both responses to declare the candidate release identity, without
   treating that declaration as a live byte digest;
7. requires exact liveness, lifecycle and database readiness contracts;
8. records metrics/paging delivery state without treating a disconnected
   adapter as connected; and
9. writes a content-minimised `valo.deployment-verification` JSON artifact with
   the run-attestation digest and bounded run identity.

For a private edge, store the complete HTTP `Authorization` value as the
protected environment secret `VALO_READINESS_AUTHORIZATION`. Leave it absent
when no edge authorization is required. If GitHub-hosted runners cannot reach
the private deployment, run the same verifier from an approved private runner;
do not weaken the endpoint, publish a credential, or record an unverifiable
manual `200` claim.

The JSON record is evidence, not deployment authority. Add its workflow/artifact
ID and digest to the private deployment record alongside approvals, migration,
backup, smoke, observation and rollback evidence.

## Target environment checklist

Before starting a release candidate or Replit publication, the release owner
must retain a redacted configuration inventory and approval evidence for the
target. Never hardcode these values in either workflow or source configuration.

- Authentication is a baseline production adapter. Supply approved
  `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` and `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` references and set
  `CLERK_ADAPTER_PRODUCTION_APPROVED=true` only after the named security/privacy
  approver accepts the provider, tenant, domain and key custody. Record that
  approval; a configured key pair alone is not production approval.
- Record reviewed bounded values for
  `AUTHENTICATED_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`,
  `AUTHENTICATED_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS`,
  `AUTHENTICATED_ACTOR_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` and
  `AUTHENTICATED_ACTOR_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS`. These are policy controls,
  not secrets; configuration must still be environment-scoped and included in
  the redacted digest.
- Install public-intake expiry purge only with `NODE_ENV=production`,
  `VALO_MAINTENANCE_EXECUTE=confirmed`, `VALO_MAINTENANCE_DATABASE_URL` and the
  exact `VALO_MAINTENANCE_DATABASE_ROLE`. Retain proof that this dedicated
  login is neither superuser nor `BYPASSRLS`, owns no intake table, and can
  execute only the two approved expiry functions.
- Install authenticated-rate-limit purge separately with
  `VALO_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAINTENANCE_EXECUTE=confirmed`, the maintenance URL and
  exact `VALO_MAINTENANCE_DATABASE_OWNER_ROLE`. Retain proof that the connected
  session owns the bounded purge function and table, has the reviewed global
  FORCE-RLS traversal authority, and that `valo_app_runtime` cannot execute the
  function.
- For both purge jobs, retain the platform schedule/deployment ID, exact source
  SHA, workload identity, first successful bounded run, last-success/full-cycle
  signals, alert receipt and disable procedure described in
  `OPERATIONAL_SCHEDULES.md`. Source entrypoints are not schedule evidence.

## Failure handling

Do not retry around a changed source, digest mismatch, redirect, malformed or
oversized response, missing identity header, non-200 readiness, database check
failure, or candidate artifact mutation. Preserve the failed run, identify
which source/deployment/environment binding is wrong, and create new evidence
after correction. Never edit a generated manifest or deployment record.
