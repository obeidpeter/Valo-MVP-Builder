# Role-route matrix

Status: UI exposure contract derived from current canonical backend roles and `platform-access.ts`. Backend permissions, tenant context, object state, assignments, partner relationships, access windows, feature flags, and break-glass context remain authoritative.

## Canonical roles

| Code | Backend role                           |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- |
| COO  | `client_organisation_owner`            |
| CAD  | `client_administrator`                 |
| BMG  | `bid_manager`                          |
| CON  | `contributor`                          |
| CRA  | `client_reviewer_approver`             |
| VOA  | `valo_operations_administrator`        |
| RPA  | `restricted_platform_administrator`    |
| CPA  | `consultancy_partner_administrator`    |
| CPR  | `consultancy_partner_analyst_reviewer` |
| AUD  | `read_only_auditor`                    |
| VAN  | `valo_analyst`                         |
| VQA  | `valo_quality_adviser`                 |

Legacy identity values such as `admin`, `reviewer`, `analyst`, `client_owner`, and `partner_admin` are compatibility aliases, not new tenant grants. User-facing labels should resolve to the canonical role.

## Route access

Legend: `Active` is role-eligible; `Gated` is role-eligible but commercially/provider gated; omitted roles are denied in the current frontend contract.

Frontend area checks combine role eligibility with the effective permissions returned for the selected server-authorised context. They improve navigation and control relevance but never replace server enforcement, object-state gates, assignments, or tenant checks.

## Segregation and absent roles

- Fatal governance and report sign-off retain their server checks, but the documented propose-only/independent-review role split is not yet fully reconciled with the server's broad `MANAGE_WORK` capability bundle. Treat segregation of duties as a production gate, not an accepted property of this candidate.
- Partner-derived access never grants release, deletion, privacy, billing, administration, or feature-control authority.
- A partner role alone never selects or reveals a client. Organisation discovery returns a client option only after validating an active partner membership, active relationship, active client, and the client tenant's `partner_edition` flag. Selecting that option sends its identifier as a header selector; middleware independently repeats the full relationship and permission check.
- Membership grants and lifecycle changes are re-authorised from locked, live membership/grant rows. Scheduled higher-authority grants count toward the management ceiling; self-grants, self-suspension/expiry changes, and changes that would leave no active administrator or client owner are denied and audited.
- Break-glass is time-bounded, scoped, audited, and read-only for the eligible permission set; it is not a navigation role.
- There is no canonical finance role. Billing screens must not expose an invented finance persona.
- There is no canonical authorised-signatory role. Existing sign-off uses `report:sign_off`/`package:sign_off` and a recorded signer. Corporate execution authority is a separate business fact that the backend does not yet model as a role.
- If finance or signatory responsibilities become necessary, define organisation role, permissions, grant ceiling, separation rules, schema/API changes, route mapping, and allow/deny/cross-tenant tests before UI exposure.

## Test minimum

For every route and material action, test each canonical role in owning and non-owning tenants, active and expired grants, direct and partner access, feature on/off, online/offline, and direct URL entry. Assert both the UI state and the server response; a hidden button is not a denial test.
