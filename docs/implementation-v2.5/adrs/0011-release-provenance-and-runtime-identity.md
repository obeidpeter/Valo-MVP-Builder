## Context

Valo needs to bind an reviewed merged source object, built outputs, SBOM, deployment target and observable runtime identity without claiming evidence the hosting platform cannot supply. Replit currently rebuilds from a source snapshot rather than promoting the GitHub-built artifact bytes.

## Decision

1. A release candidate starts only from an exact full commit already reachable from protected `main`. The workflow verifies exact HEAD, tracked cleanliness and ancestry before executing checked-out tooling.
2. The candidate builds the API and Workbench, generates a CycloneDX SBOM, inventories artifact files with SHA-256, and emits an immutable manifest whose `releaseSha256` binds source plus aggregate artifact identities. It reverifies the manifest before publishing one source-named GitHub artifact.
3. Deployment injects that candidate digest as environment-scoped `VALO_RELEASE_SHA256`; it is not stored in tracked deployment configuration. Health and readiness publish it only when it is a valid lowercase SHA-256 digest.
4. Protected deployment verification accepts the candidate run ID, full source SHA, immutable provider deployment ID and environment. It attests the exact successful candidate workflow run, downloads only its source-named artifact, recomputes the candidate/SBOM digests, probes exact liveness and readiness URLs without redirects, and requires the runtime-declared release identity.
5. The resulting record states `runtimeIdentityEvidence: environment_declared` and `liveArtifactDigestVerified: false` for Replit unless a provider-supplied measured runtime digest is independently verified. The exact Replit source snapshot and build/deployment evidence must be retained separately.
6. Candidate evidence and deployment verification are evidence, not deployment authority. Live branch/environment protection, reviewer approval, migration, backup, smoke, observation and rollback records remain required operational controls.

## Consequences

Source, candidate, workflow run and deployment are cryptographically cross-bound, while the remaining Replit limitation is explicit. Evidence expires from GitHub after its retention window and must be copied to the approved immutable store. A source rebuild cannot be described as build-once promotion without new measured evidence.

## Rejected

Mutable tags or short SHAs; unpinned third-party workflow actions; caller-supplied deployment URLs; redirects during verification; committing live deployment records or credentials; describing an environment header as a measured digest of running bytes.
