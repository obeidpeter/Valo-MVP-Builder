# Valo Bid Autopsy Workbench — User Manual

_A plain-language guide to the application: every surface, every screen, and the rules you will meet along the way._

This manual describes the application as it is actually built today. Where a capability is deliberately switched off — and Valo switches things off on purpose until they are safe and commercially activated — the manual says so, because a greyed-out button with a reason is part of the design, not a bug.

---

## 1. What Valo is

Valo is a workbench for **forensic tender review** in the Nigerian market. You give it a client's tender (what the government, agency, or operator asked for) and the client's bid (what they submitted or plan to submit). Valo helps a named human team find every requirement, check whether the bid answers each one, catch the defects that get bids disqualified — missing certificates, expired documents, arithmetic errors in the Bill of Quantities, formatting breaches — and produce a signed, professional report with an audit trail behind every finding.

Five principles run through everything and explain most of the rules you will bump into:

1. **The computer checks; a named human decides.** AI and deterministic engines _suggest_; nothing counts until a named reviewer confirms it, and the reviewer's identity stays on the record. Suggestions are always visually separated from confirmed findings.
2. **Everything that must be exactly right is ordinary tested code, not AI.** Arithmetic, tax reconciliation, risk scores, expiry dates, and workflow rules are deterministic — the same inputs always give the same answer. Money is never handled as floating-point numbers.
3. **No claim without evidence, and absence is never clearance.** An empty list means "the endpoint returned no records", not "everything is fine" — the screens say this in so many words. A capability claim is unusable until evidence is linked and approved.
4. **Tenant boundaries are absolute.** Every organisation's data is isolated at the database level. Your organisation choice scopes everything you see, and the server re-checks it on every request — the interface never has the final word on permissions.
5. **Nothing external happens silently.** Valo never sends a message, executes a payment, submits a bid, scrapes a website, or deletes data on its own. Where such a capability exists in the interface, it records _intent and evidence_ and tells you explicitly that no external effect occurred.

If a button seems blocked, one of these principles is almost always the reason — section 21 is a cheat-sheet for exactly which rule you have hit.

## 2. The three surfaces

The application is split into three strictly separated surfaces:

| Surface       | Who sees it                  | What it contains                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public**    | Anyone, no sign-in           | The marketing site, legal notices, and one form: **Request a Bid Autopsy**. No workspace code loads. |
| **Access**    | People signing in            | `/sign-in`, invitation acceptance, and the SSO return page, powered by the identity provider.        |
| **Workspace** | Signed-in, provisioned users | Everything else. Requires a valid session, an organisation, and a role.                              |

On any non-public page the browser tab is titled "Secure access | Valo" so workspace content never leaks into browser history or link previews.

### The public site

Visitors see a landing page pitched at Nigerian public-sector, oil-and-gas (NipeX/NCDMB) and donor-funded bid teams, with a permanent disclaimer that Valo does not guarantee any award. Supporting pages — Product, Solutions, How It Works, Security, About, Contact, Privacy, Terms — are read-only. The sample "defect register" on the landing page is labelled fictional.

The only thing an anonymous visitor can submit is the **Bid Autopsy request form** (`/request-bid-autopsy`): contact name, company, business email and telephone, tender category, bid stage, optional deadline, preferred contact method, and a privacy acknowledgement. The form takes **no documents** — deliberately. Scope, conflicts and NDA are handled by a human before any document changes hands. On success you get a request reference on screen; a retry of an unchanged submission safely reuses the same reference.

---

## 3. Signing in and choosing your organisation

1. **Sign in** at `/sign-in`. Valo is invitation-only: an administrator invites you, and you activate the invitation at `/accept-invitation`. Passwords, MFA, recovery and active sessions are managed by the identity provider (see your **Account** page later).
2. **Organisation selection.** After sign-in Valo resolves which organisations you belong to. If you have exactly one, it is selected automatically. If you have several, a full-screen **"Select an organisation"** gate lists each one with its type (Client organisation / Valo operations / Consultancy partner), your roles in it, whether your access is a direct membership or a **partner relationship**, and any expiry date on your access.
3. **Your role home.** Valo then lands you where your role works: internal staff land on the Command Centre; client roles land on the Client workspace (or Pursuits); partner roles land on the Partner workspace; auditors land on Evidence & readiness; restricted platform administrators land on Security & audit.

**Switching organisations** later is done from the switcher in the header (or the mobile menu). Switching wipes every cached record from the previous organisation before anything new loads. Switching is temporarily refused while a write is in flight — finish or cancel the in-progress action first.

Things you might see instead of the workspace, all deliberate: **Account disabled**, **Pending organisation access** (you exist but no organisation has admitted you), **Pending access** (registered identity, no role yet), and **Role configuration unsupported** (the server granted a role this app version does not know — contact an administrator rather than guessing).

---

## 4. Finding your way around

The left sidebar shows only what your role, permissions and organisation type allow, grouped under four headings:

- **Workspace** — Command Centre, Pursuits, Opportunity Sources, Intelligence Centre, Client workspace, Client Action Room, Partner workspace, Consortium Room.
- **Delivery** — Compliance (SBD corpus), Evidence Library, Pursuit Operations, Field Companion, Reviews, Reports.
- **Oversight** — Clients, Portfolio intelligence, Getting Started & Offers, Billing & entitlements, Commercial & Retainer, Commercial & Claims Desk, Notifications, Communication Receipts.
- **Administration** — Security & audit, Privacy Operations, Production Acceptance, AI Shadow Programme, Organisation Settings, Platform Operations.

Items marked with an amber **"Pending"** chip are technically present but not commercially activated (section 20 explains feature flags).

**Global search** — press **Ctrl/⌘ + K** (or click the header search box). It searches navigation by name and, if you can see Pursuits, searches your authorised pursuits by tender title, client name or tender reference.

**Times** are shown in **West Africa Time (WAT)** wherever deadlines matter.

**Offline** — if your connection drops, a banner appears, mutation buttons disable themselves, and each governed console explains that no cached state should be trusted as current. The one place designed for offline work is the **Field Companion** (section 12).

---

## 5. Roles, permissions and access sources — the short version

Valo has many precise roles; you only need the shape:

- **Internal (Valo) roles** — analysts, quality advisers, operations administrators, and a deliberately restricted platform administrator. These see the Command Centre, operations consoles and administration surfaces.
- **Client roles** — organisation owner, administrator, bid lead, contributor, reviewer/approver, auditor. These see their own pursuits, the client portal and client action room.
- **Partner roles** — consultancy partner administrators and analyst/reviewers. These see the partner workspace and, through the organisation switcher, the client contexts their relationship grants.
- **Auditors** — read-only roles that land on Evidence & readiness and can read audit surfaces.

Two further distinctions matter in practice:

1. **Permission-gated buttons.** Even inside a page you can see, individual actions appear only with the matching server permission (for example `defect:write` to run BOQ checks, `evidence:approve` to confirm evidence, `report:sign_off` to sign a report). If a colleague has a button you lack, that is the reason.
2. **Direct membership vs partner-derived access.** Nine sensitive workspaces — Getting Started & Offers, Opportunity Sources, Client Action Room, Production Acceptance, AI Shadow Programme, Field Companion, Privacy Operations, Commercial & Retainer, and Claims Desk — require a **direct membership** in the selected organisation. Partner-derived and emergency access are refused there by design, and each page says so.

Every access decision is enforced by the server; the sidebar merely reflects it.

---

## 6. The Command Centre (internal roles)

Your morning page. It shows, in order:

- **My Work** — your personal inbox of owned work plus unassigned work you may pick up, grouped Overdue / Today / Upcoming / Unscheduled in WAT. It is read-only by design and fails closed: if it cannot load, it says so rather than showing an empty list.
- **Attention snapshot** — four signal cards: review-SLA breaches, recorded deadlines passed, conflict blocks, and material findings.
- **Pursuit decisions and next actions** — a prioritised list; each row names why it needs you ("Review SLA breached", "Conflict decision blocks intake", "N fatal finding(s) recorded", "Payment confirmation pending") and links straight into the pursuit.
- **Submission deadline register**, **workflow exceptions**, **evidence validity exceptions**, and **Gate 0 readiness** metric cards.

If a data source fails to load, the dashboard shows a distinct failure panel and warns — repeatedly, on purpose — that an unavailable count must not be read as zero.

---

## 7. Clients, the Certificate Vault and the Capability Library

**Clients** (`/clients`) is a card grid of client organisations with NDA status, segment, sector and project count. With `client:create` you can add a client, including the Gate-0 relationship metrics (decision-maker talks, junior contacts).

Each **client detail page** contains, besides the editable profile:

- **Certificate Vault** — the register of compliance artefacts every Nigerian bid keeps needing: CAC registration, FIRS tax clearance, PENCOM, ITF, NSITF, group life insurance, audited accounts, BPP/CCSP, NCDMB/NipeX registrations, sector licences, ISO certificates, bond facilities. Each row shows issuer, dates, a renewal lead, a colour-coded expiry badge ("Expired 12d ago", "34d left"), and optionally a linked source document with its SHA-256 hash. Vault seeding is a standard step of every new engagement.
- **Capability Library** — claims about past projects, personnel, equipment and certifications. **A claim is unusable in drafts until an evidence document is linked and the claim approved.** Unsupported claims are flagged, never silently filled in.

---

## 8. Pursuits — the register and the workspace

### The register (`/projects`)

A filterable table of all tender projects: search, status, risk, client, reviewer, WAT deadline windows, and sort options, all kept in the URL so you can share a filtered view. With `project:create`, **New Project** collects the client, tender identity, WAT submission deadline, the assigned reviewer (only active, current, directly-authorised reviewers are offered), SLA class, physical-archive and redaction instructions, and a **Restricted mode** switch for highly sensitive engagements.

**Every project starts payment-pending.** This is the commercial gate: analytical work can proceed, but release actions stay blocked until payment is confirmed by **two different named people** (founder and advisor legs) on the project's Overview tab.

### The pursuit workspace (`/projects/:id`)

The header shows status, risk band and outcome, plus the **Mandate Quality** selector (autopsy-only / assisted bid / retainer). Ten tabs:

1. **Overview & next actions** — the **Project Readiness Gate** (a live checklist with a "next action" jump button; it refuses to rule at all if any underlying register failed to load), project metadata including model cost so far, the **Governance & Gates** card (status, SLA class, archive and redaction instructions, restricted mode, read-only conflict and payment state, and the two payment-confirmation legs), a per-project **notification log** (deadline reminders, payment confirmations, certificate renewals, report-ready notices — recorded, not dispatched), and for authorised users a **Retention Request** entry point.
2. **Tender documents** — the document register with type, redaction status, extraction status and an integrity **Verify** action that re-hashes the stored object. Documents arrive **excluded** from processing by default; a reviewer must deliberately include (or redact) them before extraction can read them. **New generic uploads are deliberately disabled** ("Upload unavailable") until the durable-lease upload path is verified; governed uploads happen through the Client Action Room (section 14).
3. **Requirements** — the requirement matrix. **AI Extraction** proposes requirements with grounded source quotes; each row shows its origin (engine vs manual), confidence, and review state. Reviewers confirm (✓), reject (✗), or edit — an edited row keeps the engine's original proposal visible. A **Gate 0 scorecard** tracks mandatory-requirement recall against the 85% gate. **Merge** lets you combine duplicate requirements; linked evidence and defects move to the surviving row.
4. **Evidence & compliance** — the evidence map binding requirements to documents with a status (present / missing / expired / unclear / not applicable / pending) and a verbatim excerpt. **Auto-Map** suggests bindings; only holders of `evidence:approve` can confirm them.
5. **BOQ** — the Bill-of-Quantities verifier, in two layers:
   - **Arithmetic checks (BOQ Lite).** Load figures by uploading a CSV/XLSX or pasting rows, map the columns (item ref, quantity, rate, amount…), optionally enter the declared grand total, and run. Tolerance defaults to zero — one kobo of drift is a finding. Any flagged row can be pushed to the defect register with one click.
   - **Commercial verification.** The deeper layer reconciles a whole lot against the **pinned Nigeria rule pack** (`ng-commercial-boq/v1`): line extensions, lot net, discount, taxable base, **VAT at 7.5%**, gross, net payable and bid security, all in exact kobo arithmetic. You select the governed source document the figures came from, enter the declared totals from the bid schedule, and run. Every discrepancy becomes a recorded **exception** with an exact expected/actual amount and a severity; exceptions stay open until a defect reviewer records a named resolution or waiver with a reason. Withholding-tax verification is deliberately disabled pending legal sign-off of category rates — declaring WHT raises its own exception rather than being silently accepted. Each run is stored permanently with the rule-pack version and the document version it verified, so a pass is reproducible — and a pass is an arithmetic statement, never a pricing or award opinion.
6. **Issues & red team** — the defect register (suggested / open / remediated / waived; severities fatal → cosmetic; types from omission to validity). A red banner counts open fatal and likely-fatal defects: report sign-off is blocked until each has a persisted remediation, waiver or reclassification. Severity can be raised but never lowered once recorded, and only reviewers change severity.
7. **Risk review** — the computed disqualification-risk band and score, plus a reviewer-only override that requires both a band and a written justification, and shows who set any active override.
8. **Delivery Studio** — the governed path from response to operator hand-off:
   - **Response Studio** stores immutable section versions and a claim register. Exact-quote claims are checked against the selected current document version; factual and instructional claims without valid citations, plus unresolved placeholders, remain blocked. Opinion claims may be uncited. Paraphrases always require a different named reviewer.
   - **Red-team review** records a policy version, the exact current response-source hash, findings, resolutions and an independent approval. A source change makes the approval stale; an empty findings list is not silently treated as approval.
   - **Package assembly** freezes the current reviewed inputs into a content-addressed manifest. Assembly is not signing, visual QA, export, delivery or submission, and those separate controls remain in force.
   - **Submission rehearsal** checks a reviewed portal profile and frozen package files for order, names, extensions, sizes, mappings and manual declarations. It never stores credentials, logs in, accepts a declaration, uploads or clicks submit.
9. **Package & export** — report generation, the version table, sign-off (a fixed attestation recorded against a named reviewer), and DOCX/PDF/ZIP downloads that are only offered on signed-off versions. Sign-off and export recheck the current Response Studio claims and the exact, non-stale red-team source hash. Blocked actions explain themselves ("Resolve any open fatal defects…", "Confirm physical archive instructions…").
10. **Activity & audit** — the tamper-evident event timeline. Records from the migrated legacy system are amber-badged "Legacy v1 archive" with their integrity status, distinct from "Active v2 chain record" rows.

---

## 9. Compliance corpus — Standard Bidding Documents (`/sbd`)

A normalised library of Nigerian Standard Bidding Documents: code, category (Goods / Works / Consultancy / Non-Consultancy / Special), version, status (draft / active / superseded) and issuing circular. Reviewers can add templates, create new versions, and record **agency-format annotations** — the BPP/NNPC-style quirks ("ITB 12.1 must be answered in the agency's own table format") that keep disqualifying bids. Use this corpus to normalise requirements once and reuse them across pursuits.

---

## 10. Intelligence Centre (`/intelligence`)

The decision-support console. It requires the full set of read permissions over the underlying sources — if you lack any, the page tells you and loads nothing.

What you will find: pursuit-scoped evidence metrics, the current runtime level, restricted-mode and "production model execution is disabled" notices where applicable, a **review inbox** where a reviewer with `intelligence:review` claims an item and records a decision (both actions carry exact source-version hashes — if the source changed under you, the claim is refused as stale), and the **decision-support catalogue** of capabilities. The closing "decision contract" is worth reading once: suggestions may be wrong; open the named source; your identity stays on the decision; Valo does not approve evidence, waive findings, set prices, predict awards or submit bids.

---

## 11. Operations consoles (internal roles)

**Reviews (`/operations`)** — connected signals (tracked engagements, SLA breaches, red-team due, expired evidence), a "requires attention" list linking into pursuits, and the read-only **AI control plane** evidence: the global kill switch, release-gate blockers in plain English, the capability policy grid, budget state, and recent AI/evaluation runs. The console is honest about queues that are only partially wired.

**Pursuit Operations (`/pursuit-operations`)** — the working suite for the operational side of a pursuit: authorised opportunity intake, the work board, the client evidence request room, the submission war room and visual package QA, credential verification, pre-bid/site-visit mission control, and post-award delivery control. Every board carries its "human authority" boundary note, and a **low-bandwidth mobile queue** (`?view=mobile`) exists for field conditions.

---

## 12. Field Companion (`/field-companion`) — offline notes done safely

For site visits and delivery runs where connectivity is unreliable. Drafts (site-visit notes, delivery receipt notes, checklist progress) are **encrypted locally in your browser**, partitioned to your identity and your organisation, and **expire after seven days, non-extendable**. There is no background sync and no file/photo capture — this is a draft-only boundary.

When you are back online and hold `project:update`, a **promotion review** lets you copy one draft into one compatible governed work item after inspecting a field-level diff; the draft then records its receipt hash but remains local and is explicitly "not evidence". A destructive wipe control (`WIPE MY DRAFTS`) deletes your local key and drafts on that browser.

One warning the page makes itself: a shared browser profile is not a security boundary — use your own OS/browser profile on shared devices.

---

## 13. Getting Started & Offers, and Opportunity Sources

**Getting Started & Offers (`/growth-operations`)** — three things: a **lead operations inbox** for qualifying interest before conversion (assignment, SLA, status decisions, a purpose-bound contact hand-off, and conversion _proposals_ — no CRM, no messaging, no autonomous anything); a **first-pursuit onboarding** checklist with self-recorded practice markers and a synthetic guided tour; and the **versioned offer catalogue** — per-SKU scope cards with explicit inclusions and exclusions, and "Human quote required · External manual payment only" on every card.

**Opportunity Sources (`/opportunity-sources`)** — a bounded, manual pilot register of official tender sources. You record an official source URL, work the review inbox (accept/reject with a written reason, version-guarded), and hand an accepted opportunity to a pursuit — which requires a client and an independent reviewer and surfaces conflicts before anything is created. There is **no scraping or acquisition adapter**, source text is treated as untrusted, and the register has a lifetime cap per organisation; intake stops at capacity pending a reviewed retention migration.

---

## 14. The client-facing rooms

**Client workspace (`/portal`)** — a read-only summary for client roles: open pursuits, fatal-blocker counts, workflow alerts, evidence expiry, deadlines in WAT, and recorded next steps. It appears when the client-portal feature flag is activated; until then the page says "Client portal requires activation".

**Client Action Room (`/client-actions`)** — the governed way documents get from a client into a pursuit. An authorised person creates a **bounded evidence request** naming a recipient from a server-supplied directory; the recipient performs a **governed upload into that exact request slot** (a lease is issued, the object uploaded, then finalised — only one governed upload may be in flight at a time); reviewers accept or request changes; and released-package **acknowledgements** are recorded against an exact package version. No email or free-form messaging happens here, and the room closes for new requests once the pursuit is signed off, exported or archived.

---

## 15. Partner workspaces

**Partner workspace (`/partner`)** — read-only signals for consultancy partners: assigned client relationships (identified by client identifier, with lifecycle badges, co-signing requirements and QA responsibility text), the selected tenant's pursuits, and evidence expiry. Client contexts are entered only through the global organisation switcher, so the tenant boundary stays intact.

**Consortium Room (`/consortium-room`)** — a bounded coordination ledger for exactly one active partner relationship and one client-owned project: a bilateral **responsibility matrix** (maker-checker on both sides) and a **QA/co-sign checklist**. Initialising a room requires naming both coordinators from a server-authorised directory. Released pursuits are read-only. There is no external messaging and no settlement here.

Both pages appear when the partner-workspace feature flag is activated.

---

## 16. Evidence & readiness, renewals, and the reports directory

**Evidence Library (`/evidence-readiness`)** — the portfolio exception view: fatal-defect projects, conflict blocks, pending payment gates, expired evidence, and the expiry-window register. Its standing panel says the important thing: portfolio signals are not a release decision.

**Evidence renewals (`/evidence-renewals`)** — governed renewal plans per pursuit: create a plan, stage a canonical replacement document, review the affected-pursuit impact, and record an **independent verifier decision**. Every action produces a hash receipt and confirms "no external message sent".

**Reports (`/reports`)** — a portfolio directory of report records with version counts and latest status, linking into each pursuit. Rows whose register failed to load say "Unavailable" and are excluded from counts. Report presence is not submission readiness — generation, sign-off and export stay project-scoped.

**Portfolio intelligence (`/portfolio-intelligence`)** — a tenant-local operating view of response, red-team, package and rehearsal status across the pursuits you are authorised to see. Filters and drill-downs lead back to the authoritative project records. Counts are descriptive workflow evidence only: this page does not predict awards, infer evaluator behaviour, train a model, compare tenants or authorise release.

---

## 17. Commercial surfaces

**Billing & entitlements (`/billing`)** — a transparency page. Until commercial activation it makes no orders, invoices, payments or grants, and its capability cards say precisely what is unavailable, blocked, partial or pending.

**Commercial & Retainer (`/commercial-retainer`)** — the human-controlled quote-to-cash ledger: fixed offers, maker-checker approval, manual invoice records, payment **evidence** records (no payment provider is connected), entitlements, and retainer service requests. The page verifies its own safety contract on load — automatic pricing disallowed, no payment provider, no external messaging, maker-checker required — and refuses to render a snapshot that violates it.

**Commercial & Claims Desk (`/claims-desk`)** — the post-award claims and contract-events ledger: register contract events, notice deadlines, variations, claims, payment certificates and obligations, with evidence bindings to governed documents and version-guarded maker-checker transitions. Every write returns a receipt hash. The desk records evidence and positions; it cannot dispatch notices, determine legal entitlement, price work, or touch invoices and payments.

---

## 18. Notifications and communication receipts

**Notifications (`/notifications`)** — a status console. The global dispatcher is not connected, and the page's six channel cards say exactly what is active (manual record) and what is not (email, WhatsApp, in-app, failure queue, digests). Per-project notification logging lives on the pursuit Overview tab.

**Communication Receipts (`/communications`)** — the reconciled communications hub, for when human-sent external communication needs evidence: queue an approved intent (approved templates only), record every external attempt **before** its effect, and check provider receipts. Its mottoes are the design: "Receipt is authority", "Human-controlled effects". Nothing is claimed as delivered without a verified receipt.

---

## 19. Administration

**Security & audit (`/app/security`)** — the stored legacy-migration integrity assessment (what was preserved, what discontinuities are known), security queue coverage (break-glass access is deliberately not exposed here), and the **monthly access review**: who touched what, when, with each row marked as a legacy-archive or active-chain record.

**Privacy Operations (`/privacy-operations`)** — minimised privacy evidence plus three named-human workflows: DSR triage, consent-withdrawal evidence, and legal-hold review, each version-guarded and optionally citing a governed document. The centre records evidence; it does not establish identity, decide legal rights, release holds, or execute deletion.

**Production Acceptance (`/production-acceptance`)** — the release evidence console for the most senior internal roles: tenant scope, immutable digests, release-candidate binding, expiry windows, and an evidence form bound to the expected release SHA-256 with a named owner. Its safe state is spelled out: **no-go**. It cannot deploy, restore or roll back anything.

**AI Shadow Programme (`/ai-shadow`)** — a no-output evaluation evidence pilot: version-bound plans, hash-only observations, and independent closure. The client hard-fails any response that does not preserve "production activation granted: false". A clean result makes a capability _eligible for governance review_ — nothing more.

**Organisation Settings (`/organisation-settings`)** — membership administration for the selected organisation: grant access by internal user ID with a role inside your delegation ceiling, set membership and role end dates (WAT end-of-day), suspend/reactivate, and edit access windows — with guards against locking yourself out or removing the last active administrator. Version conflicts reload the record rather than overwriting someone else's change.

**Platform Operations (`/settings`)** — internal platform administrators only: severity weights and risk-band cutoffs, report template text and default retention, the read-only legacy personnel table (real access changes happen in Organisation Settings), and the retention-request queue. The queue exposes live readiness evidence and, only when every server-checked precondition is verified, the explicit detach → reconcile → certify workflow. Each phase needs the current version, a typed confirmation, an idempotency key and a named-human attestation; certification requires a checker different from the preparer. Loading, stale, offline, forbidden, blocked or failed evidence hides the action. In the shipped configuration production activation is denied, so no completion data is deleted and no new certificate is issued.

**Account (`/account`)** — your own profile: current organisation context and effective roles, plus the identity provider's panel for password, MFA, sessions and recovery. Organisation access is granted by administrators, never self-service.

---

## 20. Feature flags — what "Pending" means

Some workspaces are built, tested and gated behind server-checked feature flags that are off until commercial activation: the **Client workspace**, **Partner workspace/Consortium Room**, **Billing & entitlements**, and **Notifications/Communication Receipts**. Where a flag is off you may still see the nav item with an amber **Pending** chip and a page explaining that the capability is technically present but not commercially activated. A flag can never bypass a permission, evidence, conflict, privacy or readiness gate.

---

## 21. "Why is this blocked?" — the cheat sheet

| What you see                                             | The rule you have hit                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Upload unavailable" on Tender documents                 | Generic signed uploads are disabled until the durable-lease path is verified. Use the governed Client Action Room upload.                                    |
| "Payment confirmation pending" / release actions blocked | The commercial gate: two different named people must confirm payment on the Overview tab.                                                                    |
| NDA / conflict banner on a pursuit                       | Intake is blocked until the NDA gate is resolved or a named conflict decision is recorded.                                                                   |
| Sign-off refuses                                         | Open fatal or likely-fatal defects without a persisted remediation/waiver, unresolved archive instructions, or another readiness check — the toast names it. |
| "Direct … membership required"                           | You are on partner-derived or emergency access; nine workspaces accept only direct memberships (section 5).                                                  |
| Amber "Pending" chip                                     | Feature flag not commercially activated (section 20).                                                                                                        |
| "Released pursuit is read-only"                          | Signed-off, exported or archived projects are immutable except through their explicit exception paths.                                                       |
| A 409 "changed in another session"                       | Optimistic concurrency: someone else edited the record. The page reloads it; re-apply your change.                                                           |
| "Workspace switching is temporarily blocked"             | A write is in flight; finish or cancel it, then switch organisations.                                                                                        |
| Empty list with careful wording                          | Deliberate: absence of records is never presented as compliance, readiness or delivery.                                                                      |
| Buttons disabled while a banner says you are offline     | Mutations pause offline everywhere except Field Companion drafts.                                                                                            |
| "Send notification" permanently disabled                 | No notification dispatcher is connected; only manual records exist.                                                                                          |
