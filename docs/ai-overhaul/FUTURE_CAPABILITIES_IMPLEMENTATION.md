# Future intelligence capabilities: implementation handoff

Status: **deterministic evidence and named review connected; production model execution remains disabled**.

This handoff covers the twenty-two Intelligence Centre capabilities in the
current working tree. The capability outputs remain deterministic and
read-only: they project tenant-scoped, human-review decision support from
records Valo already holds. The connected Review Inbox can persist a named
person's claim or review disposition, but that review metadata is not an
authoritative evidence approval, package release or model-execution decision.
No route in this delivery calls an AI provider.

No provider calls were made while implementing or validating this capability
set. Valo does not autonomously send a clarification, submit a tender, approve
evidence or a package, select or change a price, or make or predict an award
decision. The existing dormant schema was reused; this work adds no database
migration.

## What is connected now

- `GET /projects/{id}/intelligence` requires the complete server-side
  read-authority set for every returned data class. It returns a
  content-minimised snapshot, deterministic evidence-layer summary and Review
  Inbox for exactly one server-authorised pursuit.
- `POST /projects/{id}/intelligence/evidence-search` performs bounded lexical
  retrieval over the exact current manifest of accepted, verified spans. It
  validates tenant, project, actor permissions, document visibility, source
  versions and hashes and fails closed on stale manifests. Every match marks
  document text with `instructionAuthority: none`. It invokes no model, vector
  service or external tool and writes no search output.
- `POST /projects/{id}/intelligence/reviews/claim` and
  `POST /projects/{id}/intelligence/reviews/decision` persist named review
  responsibility and dispositions with source-manifest and optimistic-version
  checks. They require explicit `intelligence:review` authority, emit audit
  events and never approve source evidence, release a package or authorise
  model execution.
- The Intelligence read and evidence-search routes return explicit
  empty/partial/restricted states or `abstain`/`blocked` dispositions as
  applicable and set `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.
- The snapshot joins existing project, document/version, requirement/citation,
  evidence, Vault, capability, draft/claim, defect, BOQ, package, report, task,
  opportunity and outcome records. Missing evidence stays missing; it is never
  converted into an approval, score or inferred obligation.
- `/intelligence` is a protected Intelligence Centre screen with pursuit
  selection, loading/error/empty/partial/restricted handling, source locators,
  the Review Inbox and the human-control boundary for every card.
- The OpenAPI operations and generated clients expose the same twenty-two-item,
  evidence-search and named-review contracts.
  `productionAiEnabled` is intentionally `false` for this release.
- Pure, deterministic domain functions provide fail-closed building blocks for
  all twenty-two capabilities. They validate source scope, versions, exact
  citations, review state and bounded inputs where applicable; they do not
  persist capability outputs or perform external actions. Only the separate,
  named Review Inbox workflow persists human review metadata.

The connected evidence layer resolves whether a citation's verifier is a
currently active, direct member of the same tenant with a current native role
grant containing `evidence:approve`. Existing rows do not contain an immutable
attestation of the verifier's authority at the historical verification time.
The current-state check must therefore not be represented as historical proof,
and production model activation remains blocked until that provenance is
persisted and independently validated.

The public snapshot states are `review_ready`, `partial`, `empty`, `restricted`
and `production_disabled`. `review_ready` is emitted only when the
capability-specific, joined and provenance-checked prerequisites are present;
it means that recorded material is ready for a person to inspect. It never
means approved, eligible, compliant, priced, submitted or awarded.

## Capability boundary

The **current capability runtime level is Level 0 for every row**: deterministic
projection only, with no model output and no mutation of capability source data
or generated drafts. The Review Inbox can mutate only named human-review
metadata. The “bounded product ceiling” below describes the most autonomous
future behaviour represented by the product catalogue, not an enabled runtime.
Level 1 is a non-persistent preview; Level 2 is a reversible proposal or draft
that still requires named-human review. No Level 3 bounded action or Level 4
autonomous consequential action is authorised.

## Deterministic API map

The public API is implemented by
[`routes/intelligence.ts`](../../artifacts/api-server/src/routes/intelligence.ts)
and the content-minimised projection by
[`snapshot.ts`](../../artifacts/api-server/src/lib/intelligence/snapshot.ts).
The deterministic verified-span layer and its tenant-scoped storage adapter are
implemented by
[`evidenceLayer.ts`](../../artifacts/api-server/src/lib/intelligence/evidenceLayer.ts)
and
[`evidenceLayerStore.ts`](../../artifacts/api-server/src/lib/intelligence/evidenceLayerStore.ts).
Review projection and source-version-bound mutations are implemented by
[`reviewInbox.ts`](../../artifacts/api-server/src/lib/intelligence/reviewInbox.ts)
and
[`intelligenceReviewStore.ts`](../../artifacts/api-server/src/lib/intelligence/intelligenceReviewStore.ts).
The internal deterministic function surface is exported from
[`lib/intelligence/index.ts`](../../artifacts/api-server/src/lib/intelligence/index.ts):

The HTTP contract is in
[`openapi.yaml`](../../lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml), and the protected screen is
connected by
[`intelligence-centre-route.tsx`](../../artifacts/valo-workbench/src/pages/intelligence-centre-route.tsx).
Unit and static tests sit beside the deterministic engines, route and UI.

## Safety and authority invariants

- Tenant and project scope is established by the authenticated request,
  permission middleware and existing database isolation controls. Internal pure
  functions are not standalone authorisation boundaries.
- Active source version, lifecycle state, authority, role visibility and exact
  source quotations are validated before a bounded proposal can be used.
- Restricted Mode and absent/partial evidence fail closed. The UI does not hide
  those states behind a confidence score.
- Model execution, model-output or draft persistence, notifications, emails,
  portal operations, submissions, authoritative approvals, pricing changes,
  award decisions and downstream task creation are outside this implementation.
  Persistence is limited to named Review Inbox metadata and the disconnected
  workflow/evaluation control stores described below.
- A deterministic check passing is evidence for a reviewer, not a release
  decision. Human approval cannot be inferred from system output.
- The feature set adds no general tool-execution plane, cross-client learning or
  long-term conversational memory.

## Production blockers and next stages

1. **Authoritative retrieval:** the connected route now provides bounded,
   deterministic lexical search over accepted, hash-checked verified spans. A
   production data plane still needs immutable page/table ingestion and
   historical verifier-authority attestations, version-aware index and deletion
   reconciliation, and independent two-tenant tests. The current Copilot is an
   extractive planner, not a conversational retrieval service.
2. **Governance decisions:** approve provider/model, processing region,
   retention, privacy terms, customer-data scope, rate card and budget. Keep the
   global/capability kill switches and fail-closed gateway in the activation
   path.
3. **Durable workflow controls:** the typed Drizzle store now persists bounded,
   idempotent jobs/runs, leases, retries, cancellation, recovery and review
   records in the existing schema. No worker, scheduler, provider runner,
   transactional outbox or automated reconciliation loop is connected. Those
   runtime controls and explicit capacity admission must pass production review
   before any Level 2 model-backed draft is connected.
4. **Feature evaluations:** the continuous-evaluation store now persists
   version-bound cases, runs, results, aggregate evidence and named reviews in
   the existing schema. No evaluation runner, authorised production holdout,
   live observation feed or release-approval writer is connected.
   Representative and adversarial cohorts for citation correctness,
   abstention, addendum recall, eligibility false claims, BOQ arithmetic and
   scope leakage still need independent adjudication and approved release
   thresholds.
5. **Operational proof:** exercise shadow, pilot and canary stages; verify
   concurrency, cost ceilings, alert delivery, incident handling, rollback and
   Restricted Mode in a production-like environment.
6. **Separate product approval:** only after the preceding controls pass should
   an owner decide whether any model-backed Level 1 preview or Level 2 reversible
   draft is worth enabling. Send/submit/approve/price/award actions remain out of
   scope and require a separate threat model and authority decision.

Until those stages are complete, the connected Intelligence Centre is a
deterministic review surface. It is not evidence that production AI has been
approved or enabled.
