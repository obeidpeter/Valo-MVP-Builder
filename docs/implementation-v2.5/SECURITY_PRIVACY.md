# Security, privacy and Nigeria rule-pack plan

Status: normative security/privacy target. This is not legal advice. Legal conclusions and production rule packs require approval by Nigerian counsel/privacy leadership and named operational owners.

## Security objectives

1. Keep tenant data isolated in database, storage, search, cache, logs, jobs and AI context.
2. Preserve source/provenance and make sensitive decisions attributable and externally tamper-evident.
3. Prevent unsupported claims, fatal-gate bypass, commercial-figure generation and unauthorised provider use.
4. Minimise personal/commercial data, enforce retention/holds/rights, and govern cross-border processing.
5. Fail safely under malicious files, provider outage, concurrency, stale state and operator error.

## Data classification

| Class        | Examples                                                                                              | Baseline handling                                                                              |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Restricted   | Tender/bid documents, BOQs, credentials, personnel IDs/CVs, signed packages, payment/provider secrets | Tenant scoped; encryption; no ordinary logs; narrow team; signed downloads; no shared training |
| Confidential | Requirements, evidence excerpts, defects, drafts, capability facts, audit details                     | Tenant scoped; least privilege; redacted telemetry                                             |
| Internal     | Operational queue metadata, non-sensitive configuration, aggregate service health                     | Valo staff scope; no client content                                                            |
| Public       | Approved marketing pages and explicitly published benchmark releases                                  | Publication approval and provenance required                                                   |

## Controller/processor responsibility map

| Processing purpose                                                  | Provisional role                               | Required governance                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account, security, billing, abuse prevention, Valo legal records    | Valo as controller                             | Privacy notice, lawful-basis record, retention, rights route                                  |
| Client tender/bid/evidence processing to deliver contracted service | Valo as processor; client normally controller  | DPA/instructions, confidentiality, subprocessor register, deletion/return, assistance clauses |
| Independent integrity/security incident records                     | Valo may be controller for the limited purpose | Necessity, access restriction, minimisation, documented balancing/legal analysis              |
| Optional benchmark/flagship dataset                                 | Separate controller-purpose analysis           | Specific informed opt-in/contract terms, withdrawal path, cohort safeguards; off by default   |
| Partner-managed workspace                                           | Roles depend on ownership/instructions         | Written responsibility matrix among client, partner and Valo before activation                |

The actual role can vary by engagement and purpose; one blanket label is prohibited.

## Privacy controls

- Maintain records of processing, data inventory, purpose, data category, subject category, lawful basis, recipient/subprocessor, location, retention and security measures.
- Use consent only where appropriate and freely withdrawable; contract, legal obligation or legitimate interest require their own recorded analysis. Consent is mandatory for optional benchmark participation and direct marketing unless counsel approves another basis.
- Capture privacy/terms/NDA versions, actor, time and channel. A withdrawal is append-only and affects future processing/benchmark releases without deleting evidence required by law/hold.
- Provide authenticated access, rectification, objection/restriction, portability/erasure and complaint request workflows with identity verification, due-date calculation and exception/legal-hold reasoning.
- Conduct a DPIA before production use involving large-scale sensitive/commercial documents, AI-assisted profiling/classification, partner data sharing, benchmark publication, novel cross-border processing or other high risk.
- Appoint/record a DPO and DCPMI/CAR obligations where the approved rule pack determines they apply.
- Processor incidents notify the controller without undue delay; Valo's incident decision engine uses the effective NDPA/GAID rule pack and counsel-approved thresholds. Internal escalation target is immediate, not the external deadline.
- Cross-border transfer is off until destination, provider, categories, purpose, transfer ground/instrument, safeguards, onward transfer and retention have been approved. Tenant routing must enforce the decision.

## Authentication and session controls

MFA is required for Valo, partner admins and client owners/approvers; risk-based step-up applies to exports, role grants, break-glass, payment changes and sign-off. Sessions use secure/HttpOnly/SameSite cookies, CSRF protection where applicable, rotation, absolute/idle expiry and revocation on role/security change. API rate limits are identity+tenant+operation aware and do not leak resource existence.

## Cryptography and secrets

TLS 1.2+ (prefer 1.3), managed encryption at rest, separate environment keys, rotation/versioning and least-privilege service identities. Sensitive object encryption can use tenant-scoped envelope keys where supported. Secrets live only in approved secret management; logs/errors/build artefacts never contain them. Passwords are delegated to the approved identity provider.

## Audit protection

Each event contains sequence, previous hash, event hash, tenant, actor, purpose/reason, correlation/causation, action, object, result and before/after digests. Periodic Merkle/root checkpoints are signed and published to an immutable external destination with retention lock or equivalent independent witness. Reconciliation alerts on missing sequence, invalid chain, missing/late anchor or restored database divergence. Hashing alone inside the same mutable database is insufficient.

## Retention, legal hold and deletion

Retention is purpose/category/contract/rule-pack driven, not a single “12 months” constant. Legal hold prevents eligible deletion and records authority/scope/review. A deletion workflow covers primary rows, object versions, derived OCR/search/vector/cache, provider copies where contractually controllable, exports and backup expiry; it verifies actions before issuing a signed certificate. Audit/accounting/legal evidence retained under an approved exception is minimised and listed transparently.

## Nigeria rule-pack governance

Rules that can change - tax/VAT, bid security, procurement thresholds/templates, statutory certificate assumptions, privacy reporting/registration, holidays/business calendars and retention - are configuration, not code literals.

Each pack contains:

```text
pack_id, jurisdiction, domain, semantic_version, status=draft|approved|superseded|withdrawn
effective_from, effective_to, as_of_date, authoritative_source_urls
source_document_hashes, extracted_rules, applicability/precedence, calculation tests
prepared_by, legal_reviewer, product_owner, approved_at, supersedes
```

Activation is signed, dual-controlled, audited and prospective. Historical calculations retain the pack version. Tender-specific instructions take precedence where lawful and are a separate signed overlay. If applicability is ambiguous, BOQ/readiness returns `needs_legal_review`; it never guesses.

## Authoritative source register (verified online 2026-08-08)

`effective_to` remains open only until a superseding pack is approved; the regulatory watch must close prior versions prospectively. A tender overlay records its own issue/addendum/effective dates and can narrow a general pack. “Inactive” means production calculation/readiness must return configuration/legal review required, not fall back to a hard-coded legacy value.

The Business Plan's working certificate taxonomy, thresholds, VAT assumptions and third-party market sources are hypotheses/reference material, not authoritative executable rules. Product copy must say “required by this tender/rule pack” rather than imply every Nigerian tender requires the same artefacts.

## Rule-pack discrepancies and open legal decisions

1. TRD v1.0 cites BP v1.2/Roadmap v1.1, but only BP v1.1/Roadmap v1.0 were supplied; no unreviewed rule from missing documents is adopted.
2. Older TRD text uses a fixed `k >= 8` benchmark gate. v2.5 replaces this with contextual minimum cohort plus small-cell, differencing, withdrawal and re-identification controls.
3. Older TRD text presents fixed 12-month/14-day retention as “NDPR-aligned.” Retention/rights deadlines require current NDPA/GAID/contract/legal analysis; keep configurable until approved.
4. Business Plan procurement thresholds and certificate lists must be re-verified against BPP/tender-specific instruments before any rule-pack approval.
5. Tax/VAT logic must use the Nigeria Tax Act 2025 regime effective from 2026-01-01 with transition rules where relevant; no previous VAT/tax constant may be copied blindly.

## Production security gates

No GA activation until RLS/storage/search/AI negative tests pass; repository visibility is verified; secret/SAST/dependency/container/IaC scans have no unresolved high/critical finding; DPIA/DPA/subprocessor/transfer records are approved; incident and DSR drills run; backup restore and audit-anchor recovery pass; and access/feature/development-adapter configuration is attested in the deployment record.
